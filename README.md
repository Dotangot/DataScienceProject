## [Check out our project presentation!](https://github.com/Dotangot/FirstDataScienceProject/tree/main/Presentation)


# Introduction

* In this project, we will investigate how the market value and performance of the best 5 leagues players consists of,
and try to predict their market value and scored goals using Machine Learning with Regression

# Data Mining & Sources
* Gathering information using Crawling & API
* [FifaIndex.com](https://FifaIndex.com)
* [Understat.com](https://Understat.com)
* Concat all information to one database

# Data Cleaning & Optimizing
* Exploring & improving the data
* Drop missing values
* Get rid of duplicates & outliers
* Drop unimportant columns
* Convert categorical columns to numeric, and more...

# EDA
* Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualisations

# Machine Learning
* Applying Linear Regression algorithm
* Predicting football player's market value & goals for 19/20 season

# Wow Effect
* Using our imagination, we trying to emphasize our research findings
